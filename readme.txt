UI interface for using the aSlyder slideshow engine in the Wordpress environment

== Description ==

This plugin brings the power and flexibility of the aSlyder slideshow engine to the Wordpress admin panel, making it a great tool for theme architects to include a highly-customized slideshow in their themes, while still making it easily configurable for the site administrators.  A single function brings a robust slideshow application to any theme page.

This plugin is not a quick fix plug-n-play slideshow.  It brings the aSlyder engine easily into Wordpress, and offers admin panel configuration, however this plugin was designed for the savvy developer in mind. A skin for the slideshow must be designed and CSS must be applied for the engine to work.  While set up and configuration is so easy its bordering on ridiculous, it still requires some know-how to put into operation.  This was intended to be a tool for the professional developer, rather than a solution for the casual Wordpress webmaster.

Fully skinnable with virtually unlimited styling potential. Never style your site around the plugin again!  Navigation buttons for previous/next, individual slides and thumbnails can be placed anywhere on the page, giving maximum flexibility and freedom over layout design.

The plugin uses the same aSlyder engine as a non-plugin version, so all of the power and flexibility is still available for theming with no restrictions!
